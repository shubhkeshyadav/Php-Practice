    An array A consisting of N integers is given. The average value of array A is defined as:
    (A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[N−1]) / N
    The deviation of element A[P] (where 0 ≤ P < N) is defined as |A[P] − M|, where M is the average value of 
    array A.
    Element A[P] is called extreme if its deviation is maximal among all the elements of A.
    For example, consider the following array A consisting of four elements:
    A[0] = 9 
    A[1] = 4 
    A[2] = -3 
    A[3] = -10
    The average value of this array is (9 + 4 + (−3) + (−10)) / 4 = 0. The deviation of element A[2] is |(-3) -
    0| = |0 - (-3)| = 3. The deviation of element A[3] is 10. It is an extreme element of array A, since no 
    other element has a deviation greater than 10. There are no other extreme elements in this array.
    Write a function:
    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
    that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the index of an extreme element. If more than one 
    extreme element exists, the function may return the index of any of them. If the array is empty (and hence 
    no extreme element exists), the function should return −1.
    For example, given array A shown above, the function should return 3, since A[3] is the only extreme 
    element.
    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    • N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
    • each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]
