SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles and is a series of guidelines that developers can use to build software in an easy way to maintain and extend. Understanding these concepts will make you a better developer and enable you to avoid code smells.

SOLID stands for:

    S: Single-responsibility principle
    O: Open-closed principle
    L: Liskov substitution principle
    I: Interface segregation principle
