To communicate from client to server. During cummunication we can share data to server
there are blelow method on which we can send data to server

1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
5. PATCH

6. Get

   - GET data can we visible in url . You only can send 2 KB data throgh get method
   - this is idempotent (nothing side effect would be once you hit same request multiple time)

7. POST

   - POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
   - DATA don't visible any where when you use post mehtod. By default you can send 8MB data through post method. But you can change it through php.ini file.
   - The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:
   - post is not idempotent (multiple request may create multiple resources(record))

8. PUT

   - in normally we sould use put when we updating any thing over server
   - this is idempotent means nothing wil happen once you hit multiple time

9. PATCH

   - patch method should be for partial update the any things
   - this is also idempotent nothing will happen once you hit multiple time

10. DELETE

    - Delete method should be use while deleting any record
    - this is also idempotent nothing will happen once you hit multiple time

    while sending the request over server you can define the http method
    like below in client side

    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH">
